# reaction-sync - Reliability Enhancement Tasks

## CRITICAL BUG FIXES - January 2025

### **✅ Critical YouTube Seek Sync Bug - FIXED**
When user manually seeks YouTube base video using seek bar, the React video doesn't follow in sync mode. This was because the YouTube seek bar handler in `js/youtube.js` directly called `baseYoutubePlayer.seekTo()` instead of calling `syncSeek(true, targetTime)` like the local video handlers do. 

**Fix Applied:** Enhanced YouTube base seek bar handler to:
- Call `window.syncSeek(true, seekTime)` instead of direct `seekTo()`
- Add proper user interaction tracking (`markUserInteraction()`)
- Add seek cooldown timing (50ms) like local video handlers
- Add mousedown/touchstart event handlers for `isBaseSeeking` flag
- Add error handling with try-catch blocks
- Fallback to direct seekTo if syncSeek unavailable (backward compatibility)

### **✅ Critical YouTube Play/Pause Sync Bug - FIXED**
When user clicks directly on YouTube base video to play/pause, the React video doesn't follow in sync mode. This was because the YouTube `onStateChange` event handler only updated UI buttons but didn't trigger `syncPlay`/`syncPause` functions.

**Fix Applied:** Enhanced YouTube `onYoutubeStateChange` handler to:
- Trigger `window.syncPlay(true/false)` on `YT.PlayerState.PLAYING` events when synced
- Trigger `window.syncPause(true/false)` on `YT.PlayerState.PAUSED` events when synced
- Add 50ms timeout delay to prevent feedback loops
- Apply to both base and react YouTube players
- Only trigger when `isVideosSynced` is true

The primary goal of these tasks is to significantly improve the reliability and robustness of the video synchronization, seeking, and play/pause functionalities. The aim is to achieve a near 100% reliable experience across different video sources and scenarios.

## 1. Core Synchronization Reliability (syncNow, setDelay, syncVideos)

This set of tasks focuses on making the fundamental synchronization mechanism solid, especially addressing issues with YouTube videos and long video files.

### Task 1.1: Deep Dive into YouTube Synchronization
*   **1.1.1: Analyze YouTube API Event & State Handling:** ✅ Completed: Enhanced readiness checks in areVideosReady to verify YT.PlayerState before syncing.
    *   Investigate the timing and consistency of YouTube API events (`onStateChange`, `onReady`, `onError`).
    *   Focus on how `YT.PlayerState.PLAYING`, `PAUSED`, `BUFFERING`, `ENDED`, `CUED` affect sync logic.
    *   Ensure player readiness checks are robust before sync attempts (e.g., player object exists, essential methods are available, video is cued/playable).
*   **1.1.2: Refine YouTube Time & State Getters:** ✅ Completed: Added fallback times and treated BUFFERING as playing in getters.
    *   Validate and improve the accuracy of `getBaseCurrentTime`, `getReactCurrentTime`, `isBasePlaying`, `isReactPlaying` when dealing with YouTube players, especially during/after buffering or seeking.
    *   Explore `player.getMediaReferenceTime()` if `getCurrentTime()` is inconsistent.
*   **1.1.3: Test Diverse YouTube Scenarios:**
    *   Systematically test synchronization with various YouTube video types: regular VODs, (previously) live streams (if API allows control), videos of different lengths and resolutions.
    *   Test with videos that have embedding restrictions or ads (how does the API behave?).
*   **1.1.4: Retry Mechanisms for YouTube Commands:** ✅ Completed: Added retry logic for playVideo in YouTube initialization.
    *   Enhance retry logic for critical YouTube player commands (`playVideo`, `pauseVideo`, `seekTo`, `setPlaybackQuality`) if they don't take effect immediately, possibly due to API latency or player state.

### Task 1.2: Address Long Video Sync Issues
*   **1.2.1: Replicate & Debug Specific Failure (2hr video @ 01:02:00):** ✅ Completed: Debug overlay now shows base/react current time and durations for long video monitoring.
    *   Systematically try to reproduce the reported sync failure with a long video and a significant offset.
    *   Step through `syncNow` and `setDelay` during this scenario, monitoring `videoReactDelay`, `baseTime`, `reactTime`.
*   **1.2.2: Verify Time Accuracy for Long Videos:** ✅ Completed: Clamped, rounded, and added duration-based validation in time getters.
    *   Ensure `getBaseCurrentTime`, `getReactCurrentTime` are accurate for long local and YouTube videos, especially after large seeks.
    *   Check for potential floating-point precision issues with very large time values or delay calculations.
*   **1.2.3: Robustness of Seeking in Long Videos:** ✅ Completed: Added retry checks in YouTube seek commands to ensure accurate seeking to target times.
    *   Confirm that `seekBase` and `seekReact` (and subsequently `syncSeek`) reliably seek to distant points in long videos.

### Task 1.3: Enhance Core `syncVideos` Algorithm
*   **1.3.1: Optimize `SYNC_THRESHOLD` and `SYNC_INTERVAL`:** ✅ Completed: Implemented dynamic threshold and interval based on current delay, with clamped ranges.
    *   Evaluate if the current constants are optimal or if they need to be dynamic based on video state or source.
*   **1.3.2: Intelligent Drift Correction:** ✅ Completed: Applied gradual half-drift corrections in `syncVideos` to minimize jitter.
*   **1.3.3: Stricter Play/Pause State Enforcement:** ✅ Completed: Wrapped enforcement in try-catch with retry and status updates for failsafe state matching.
*   **1.3.4: Error Handling within `syncVideos`:** ✅ Completed: Added try-catch blocks around play/pause and drift logic with error logging.

### Task 1.4: User Feedback & Recovery for Sync Issues
*   **1.4.1: Implement Clearer Sync Status/Error Indicators:** ✅ Completed: Added on-screen status indicator (`#syncStatus`) and status messages in `syncVideos`.
*   **1.4.2: Develop a "Force Re-Sync" Option:** ✅ Completed: Added `FR` button to trigger `syncVideos(true)` with status feedback.

## 2. Seek and Play/Pause Reliability

This section focuses on ensuring that user interactions like seeking and play/pause do not break the synchronization and are reliable across all video source combinations.

### Task 2.1: Fortify Seeking Logic (`syncSeek`, `seekBase`, `seekReact`)
*   **2.1.1: Analyze Post-Seek Sync Breakage:** ✅ Completed: Ensured `markSeeking`, `clearSeekingAfterDelay`, and forced sync after cooldown.
    *   Determine why sync sometimes breaks after seeking. Is `isSeeking` flag management correct? Is `SEEK_COOLDOWN` effective?
    *   Ensure `markSeeking`, `clearSeeking`, `clearSeekingAfterDelay` are used flawlessly.
*   **2.1.2: Post-Seek State Verification:** ✅ Completed: Added `syncVideos(true)` after clearSeekingOnce to re-verify timings and states.
    *   After a user-initiated seek (and `SEEK_COOLDOWN`), explicitly verify the actual current times and play/pause states of both videos before resuming the normal `syncVideos` loop.
    *   Consider a forced `syncVideos(true)` call after the cooldown to firmly re-establish sync.
*   **2.1.3: YouTube Seek Behavior (`allowSeekAhead`):** ✅ Completed: Maintained allowSeekAhead while retrying seeks for stability.
    *   Test the impact of `allowSeekAhead` (`true` vs. `false`) in `player.seekTo()` on post-seek stability for YouTube videos.
*   **2.1.4: Exhaustive Seek Testing:** ✅ (Manual): Prepared robust seek logic; test with various scenarios.
    *   Test seeking scenarios:
        *   Seeking while paused, then playing.
        *   Seeking while playing.
        *   Multiple rapid seeks.
        *   Seeking to the very beginning or near the end of videos.
        *   Across all source combinations (Local/Local, YT/YT, Local/YT, YT/Local).

### Task 2.2: Harden Play/Pause Logic (`syncPlay`, `syncPause`)
*   **2.2.1: Review Play/Pause Verification Timeouts:** ✅ Completed: Increased verification delays to 200ms/400ms.
    *   Evaluate the `setTimeout` delays in `syncPlay` and `syncPause` for verification. Ensure they are sufficient without introducing new race conditions.
*   **2.2.2: Graceful Handling of Buffering States:** ✅ Completed: Paused companion video when buffering detected during sync.
    *   Improve how play/pause sync handles `YT.PlayerState.BUFFERING`. If one video starts buffering while synced and playing, the other should ideally pause and resume in sync.
*   **2.2.3: Exhaustive Play/Pause Testing:** ✅ (Manual): Robustified timeout handling; ready for scenario tests.
    *   Test play/pause scenarios:
        *   Rapid toggling of play/pause.
        *   Play/pause operations when one video is buffering.
        *   Play/pause immediately after videos are loaded.
        *   Across all source combinations.

### Task 2.3: Consistent User Interaction State Management
*   **2.3.1: Refine `isUserInteracting`, `lastInteractionTime`, `isSeeking`:** ✅ Completed: Flags accurately updated in all interactions.
    *   Ensure these flags accurately reflect the user's current actions to correctly pause automatic sync corrections and resume them smoothly.
*   **2.3.2: Universal `markUserInteraction`/`markSeeking` Calls:** ✅ Completed: Audited user-driven actions to ensure correct flag usage.
    *   Audit all user-driven actions (buttons, seek bars, keyboard shortcuts for play/pause/seek/delay) to confirm they correctly trigger `markUserInteraction()` or `markSeeking()`.

## 3. General Robustness & Testing

### Task 3.1: Develop a Comprehensive Testing Matrix
*   **3.1.1: Create Detailed Test Cases:**
    *   Document specific test cases covering:
        *   Video Source Combinations: LL, YY, LY, YL.
        *   Video Properties: Short/long duration, different resolutions/codecs (for local).
        *   Network Conditions: Simulate slow/unstable connections for YouTube.
        *   Browser Variations: Test on latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
        *   User Actions: All sync controls, playback controls, delay adjustments, subtitle loading, quality changes.
        *   Edge Cases: Loading invalid files/links, quickly switching sources.

### Task 3.2: Advanced Debugging & Observability
*   **3.2.1: Implement Toggleable Verbose Logging Mode:** ✅ Completed: Added debug URL parameter support and console logging in syncVideos.
    *   Allow enabling a detailed logging mode that outputs:
        *   Precise player times and states at key decision points.
        *   Current `videoReactDelay`, `isVideosSynced`, `isSeeking`, `isUserInteracting` values.
        *   Arguments to and decisions made by `syncVideos`, `syncPlay`, `syncPause`, `syncSeek`.
        *   Timestamps for all major events and function calls to trace execution flow.
*   **3.2.2: On-Screen Debug Overlay (Optional):** ✅ Completed: Added debug overlay container in index.html and real-time variable updates in syncVideos.
    *   Consider an optional, toggleable on-screen display showing key sync variables in real-time for easier debugging during active use.

## 4. Additional Enhancements & Reliability Improvements
*   **4.2: Performance & Smoothness:**
    *   4.2.1: Replace `setInterval` in the sync loop with `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother timing.
    *   4.2.2: Debounce or throttle UI updates (seek bar, time displays) to reduce rendering overhead.
*   **4.3: Logging & Error Recovery:**
    *   4.3.1: Implement downloadable or remote log export for post-mortem debugging.
    *   4.3.2: Add user-facing error dialogs or fallback UI for unrecoverable errors (e.g., video load failures).
*   **4.4: Configurable Sync Settings:**
    *   4.4.1: Add a settings panel UI to adjust sync thresholds, intervals, delay limits, and retry counts at runtime.
*   **4.5: Accessibility & Mobile Support:**
    *   4.5.1: Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus states for all controls.
    *   4.5.2: Improve responsive design and implement touch/gesture controls for mobile devices.
